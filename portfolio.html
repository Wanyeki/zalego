When posting a job, HR has an option to choose whether she/he would like to have applicants to take a test during the application process. This particular feature helps the HR to filter out candidates who are not eligible for the Job posting. All applicants who apply for the Jobs are listed on the system allowing the HR to shortlist qualified candidates. Candidates that qualify for the interview receive an email communication notifying them of set date for the interview. Once a candidate passes the interview, the system allows HR to promote candidates who passed the interview to the next positions whether intern, attaché, or staff on contract or permanent or based on your preferred and set description.
